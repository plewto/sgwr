(ns sgwr.components.drawing
  "Defines SgwrDrawing protocol 
  A drawing is an extension of javax.swing.JPanel onto which 
  components are rendered. All drawings contain a 'root' and a
  'tool' group (See sgwr.components.group) which then contain all
  other drawing components. 

  The segregation between tool and non-tool components is to reduce
  the overhead of rendering complex drawings. Once a drawing has been
  rendered all static components may be flattened into a single image
  which greatly reduces future render times."
